Analysis Of Challenge

Background

In this project, tried to perform data analysis for the Kickstarter campaign (from the year 2009 to 2017). 

For analysis, MS Excel was used as a tool, including interactive pivot tables and charts, advanced filers, VLOOKUPs, COUNTIFs and various Excel formulas.

Purpose

Aiming how it is performing relative to other campaigns and launch dates and choosing the most appropriate time to launch new campaigns based on this data.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
